## Summary
This project explores a simulated warehouse environment where multiple autonomous robots learn to pick up and deliver different types of packages to their correct drop-off zones using reinforcement learning. 
Through repeated interaction, the robots learn to identify package types, navigate the space efficiently, and coordinate actions to complete deliveries accurately. 
The goal is to model intelligent behavior in a dynamic logistics setting without relying on predefined rules or supervision.
